					ABOUT <span className="span-head">JUNAID JAMSHED (RA)</span>
				</h1>
				<p>
					He soared to fame as the front man of one of Pakistan's most iconic pop bands. His famous patriotic
					song, “Dil Dil Pakistan” is said to be Pakistan’s second national anthem. In 2003, in BBC’s World
					Service online poll of about 7000 popular songs from all over the world, “Dil Dil Pakistan” came
					third. And then at the height of his career, he gave it up to devote his life to Allah and to spread
					HIS message throughout the whole world, and eventually, his spiritual journey also ended in this
					path. He had lived a full life with spiritual grace and departed to the hereafter with that same
					grace. He had been in the path of Allah in Chitral, and on his way back, he achieved
					shahadah(martyrdom) in the path of Allah too. He was 52.
				</p>
				<p>
					Junaid Jamshed’s efforts in the work of dawah are renowned. He emphasized his mission for the unity
					of the Muslim Ummah and the significant role of dawah, which helped him to completely alter his life
					from a pop star to a devoted servant of Islam. His qualities of forgiveness, patience, and
					confidence also played significant role in motivating Muslims living throughout the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was an icon for the public and a role model within his family. Everyone looked up to him. That's
					why he turned to religion. To seek the greater good. Even in his new incarnation, Junaid Jamshed was
					never far from the limelight.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time of his death, he had almost 2.8 million Facebook fans. That year, he was also placed in
					the list of World's 500 Most Influential Muslims. In 2018, he was posthumously nominated for the
					nation’s third highest civilian honour, the “Sitara-i-Imtiaz” and in 2020, he was awarded the
					“Lifetime Achievement Award” by the Pakistan Air Force.
				</p>
				<p>
					To conclude, Junaid Jamshed was an individual extraordinaire - he was a recording artist, television
					personality, fashion designer, occasional actor, singer-songwriter, preacher and televangelist who
					was “BORN TO INSPIRE.” He was a true patriot at heart and went on to become Islamic Republic of
					Pakistan’s largest human shadow, who was brave enough to experiment, struggle and came out stronger
					than ever. There will never be another Junaid.

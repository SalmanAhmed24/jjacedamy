					ABOUT <span className="span-head">JUNAID JAMSHED (RA)</span>
				</h1>
				<p>
					He soared to fame as the front man of one of Pakistan&apos;s most iconic pop bands. His famous
					patriotic song, “Dil Dil Pakistan” is said to be Pakistan&apos;s second national anthem. In 2003, in
					BBC&apos;s World Service online poll of about 7000 popular songs from all over the world, “Dil Dil
					Pakistan” came third. And then at the height of his career, he gave it up to devote his life to
					Allah and to spread HIS message throughout the whole world, and eventually, his spiritual journey
					also ended in this path. He had lived a full life with spiritual grace and departed to the hereafter
					with that same grace. He had been in the path of Allah in Chitral, and on his way back, he achieved
					shahadah (martyrdom) in the path of Allah too. He was 52.
				</p>
				<p>
					Junaid Jamshed&apos;s efforts in the work of dawah are renowned. He emphasized his mission for the
					unity of the Muslim Ummah and the significant role of dawah, which helped him to completely alter
					his life from a pop star to a devoted servant of Islam. His qualities of forgiveness, patience, and
					confidence also played significant role in motivating Muslims living throughout the world. He was an
					icon for the public and a role model within his family. Everyone looked up to him. That&apos;s why
					he turned to religion. To seek the greater good. Even in his new incarnation, Junaid Jamshed was
					never far from the limelight. At the time of his death, he had almost 2.8 million Facebook fans.
					That year, he was also placed in the list of World&apos;s 500 Most Influential Muslims. In 2018, he
					was posthumously nominated for the nation&apos;s third highest civilian honour, the
					“Sitara-i-Imtiaz” and in 2020, he was awarded the “Lifetime Achievement Award” by the Pakistan Air
					Force.
				</p>
				<p>
					To conclude, Junaid Jamshed was an individual extraordinaire - he was a recording artist, television
					personality, fashion designer, occasional actor, singer-songwriter, preacher and televangelist who
					was “BORN TO INSPIRE.” He was a true patriot at heart and went on to become Islamic Republic of
					Pakistan&apos;s largest human shadow, who was brave enough to experiment, struggle and came out
					stronger than ever. There will never be another Junaid.

Back then, I would think of myself as somewhat religious because I had been covering my head since I was 10 years old and also did my obligatory prayers, but that was just about it. Little did I know, a lot more was required from me by Allahï·» to be a good muslim.'

Although in America, we have the constitution that supports the freedom of religion and expression, it is not as hard as in many European countries where there are strict laws passed against Islam i.e. Hijab ban, etc. Alhamdulillah.'
